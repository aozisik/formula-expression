# PHP Formula Expression Language

This is an extension upon Symfony's great ExpressionLanguage component.

The aim of this package is to add more functionality and flexibility by introducing conditionals, loops and useful helpers.

Formula Expression Language (or shortly *FEL*) makes it possible to write multi-line expressions. Symfony's ExpressionLanguage limits you to one-liners. This becomes painful if you have complicated logic that depends on lots of conditions.
